AtliQ Mart, an FMCG organization, faced challenges such as delayed deliveries, incomplete order fulfillment, and low service-level performance across multiple cities and customers. There was no single consolidated view to monitor supply chain KPIs and identify performance gaps.

To address this, the project focused on analyzing supply chain data and building an interactive analytics solution to track order fulfillment and delivery performance. The objective was to compare actual results with defined targets and provide clear visibility for business stakeholders.

Supply chain datasets related to orders, deliveries, and quantities were cleaned, validated, and modeled. Interactive Power BI dashboards were developed, including Home, KPI Performance (OT%, IF%, OTIF%), and Orders Summary pages. Key FMCG supply chain metrics such as OT%, IF%, OTIF%, Line Fill Rate (LIFR%), and Volume Fill Rate (VOFR) were calculated using DAX, with analysis enabled across cities, customers, products, and time periods.

The dashboards helped identify underperforming regions and customers, highlighted gaps between actual and target service levels, and revealed major causes of delivery delays and order shortfalls. These insights support better inventory planning, improved delivery reliability, and stronger overall supply chain performance.
